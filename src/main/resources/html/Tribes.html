TRIBES is a parameter-free PSO implementation by Maurice Clerc. It combines several adaptive
mechanisms to achieve good performance in different domains. It uses a dynamic number of particles,
starting usually with 3 and adding new ones during optimization. Therefore, the number of generations
is not directly connected to the number of fitness calls,
because the population may grow (and seldomly shrink).<br>

Also, there are different initialization
methods implemented which are chosen randomly when particles are created. The particles are organized
in loosely connected groups or tribes (therefore the name), creating a kind of small-world topology.
<br>
As TRIBES uses an error approximation to steer the adaptations, a target value should be given, so far in the first
dimension only.
