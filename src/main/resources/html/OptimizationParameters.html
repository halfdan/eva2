<h1 align="center">Genetic Optimization Parameters</h1>
<br>
The GO parameter class is used to change main GO optimization settings. You may:
<ul>
  <li>Choose the optimizer. Check the optimizer object for further parameters and information.</li>
  <li>Set post-processing parameters or leave it turned off.</li>
  <li>Select the problem to be optimized. Check the problem instance for further parameters and information. </li>
  <li>Set a random seed. For the same positive seed, an optimization run should yield the same results. Set the seed to zero to use a dynamic seed for each run (using system time).</li>
  <li>Define the termination criterion. Usually a maximum number of fitness evaluations is set, but 
  	it is also possible to choose a maximum number of generations, an absolute fitness value to be reached, a
  	convergence criterion or a combination of those.</li>  
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> <br>
The evolutionary operators used by a strategy are tightly connected to the representation used.
On the other hand, the representation is usually defined by the underlying problem, therefore,
to change the operators effecting the individuals, select the problem and set them within the
Individual class presented there. Also note, that not all optimizers can handle all types
of representations.
