If post processing is activated, it is performed after every
optimization run and it may be triggered using the solutions of the last optimization run by
the "Post process" button.
Post processing performs both accuracy checks of the delivered solutions and a clustering/refinement of the
solutions with a local search method. The solutions are clustered to remove redundancy and the remaining
best cluster representatives are considered. </p>
<p>For the accuracy evaluation, multiple thresholds may be used. The solutions are then clustered using a distance
of 0.1 times the respective accuracy threshold and a Nelder-Mead-Simplex search is initialized in close vicinity.
As soon as the NMS search fails to produce an improved solution at a distance larger than the accuracy threshold
from the original positions, the solution is considered to be accurate by that threshold. </p>        
<p>Besides the accuracy, a refinement can be performed using several local search methods. After the refinement,
the set is clustered again to filter out solutions which converged on the same optimum during the local search.
</p>
<p>
The results of the post processing are displayed in the text window (and/or stats output file) and show a coarse
distribution of the final solutions as well as the explicit vectors of the n best solutions obtained, where n
is set as printNBest parameter.
If post-processing is started several times in a row, the initial solution set is the same, namely the one found
by optimization. Thereby one can guess, e.g., how close the solutions are to each other and how closely they
have converged during optimization itself.
