<h1 align="center">The EvA2 Genetic Optimization Module</h1>
<br>
The Genetic Optimization module allows the application of a variety of
nature-inspired heuristics within one framework. You can combine several
datatypes as representations with specific evolutionary operators and
widely independently choose an optimization strategy. Some strategies,
however, only work with certain datatypes. Most remarkably, DE and PSO
require a real-valued representations for the moment, whereas GA, for example,
is typically run with a binary datatype but also works on real valued individuals
by just accessing the analoguous evolutionary operators.
