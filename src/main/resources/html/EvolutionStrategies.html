An ES works on a population of real valued solutions
by repeated use of evolutionary operators like reproduction,
recombination and mutation.
&lambda; offspring individuals are generated from &mu; parents
by recombination and mutation (with &mu; &lt; &lambda;). 
<br>
After evaluating the fitness of the &lambda;
offspring individuals, the comma-strategy selects the &mu; individuals 
with the best fitness as parent population for the next generation.
On the other hand, a plus-strategy selects the best &mu; individuals
from the aggregation of parents and offspring individuals, so in this
case the best individual is guaranteed to survive.
In general, however, the comma-strategy is more robust and can easier
escape from local optima, which is why it is usually the standard selection.
