--- Changelog ---

2.05: Added ScatterSearch (real-valued), BinaryScatterSearch, and the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (thanks
 			to Alexander Seitz) to the base package. Added JobList and some statistical measures. Requires to put
 			the JSC package on the class path for Mann-Whitney test.

2.046: Adaptions to the MatlabInterface: explicit data types are used now, added integer problem support.
 			Additional Integer operators: segment-wise mutation and crossover. Added an abstraction over individual
 			initialization methods. Added the ERPStarter class which is an example for running a csv-configured 
 			optimization. Some bug-fixes and clean-ups.

2.045: Added MOOCMAES (de Paly); compatibility with Java 1.5 (Draeger); Revision of the statistics class
 			with improved pipelining of data (InterfaceAdditionalPopulationInformer); improved FunctionArea
 			concerning history, labels, legend and graph coloring; improved StringSelection; restructured
 			Terminators, additional ParetoMetricTerminator. Further bugfixes and clean-ups.

2.043: Added proper Population equality predicate.

2.042: Some bugfixes. Removing dependency on sun.beans.editors, replaced non-free jpeg-codec. There should
 			be no more problems on OpenJDK. Added a simple initialization range, especially for use from Matlab.
 			Some restructurings (RNG and Mathematics is now in eva2.tools.math). Some cleanup.

2.040: Several updates: The clustering interface has been changed for easier implementation of adaptive clustering
 			methods. The GradientDescentAlgorithm has been updated and some benchmark problems been made derivable.
 			The ClusterBasedNiching algorithm has been slightly restructured updated according to the new clustering.
 			An additional clustering method is included: nearest-best clustering with dynamic adaption of niche radius.
 			Some changes to (text) statistics: they are now printed regarding the full solution set instead of the
 			last population. The Population field "size" is now termed "targetSize" to avoid misunderstandigs. Populations
 			can be initialized using a Random Latin Hypercube sampling. Some basic console options are recognized:
 			EvA2 can be started without splash screen and even without GUI. If configuration file is given which was 
 			earlier saved from the GUI, the thus defined optimization run is then processed automatically by EvA2. 

2.036: New graph selection mode for statistic plots: every property may be selected independently.
 			A simple plot legend is produced in the graph window, which can be deactivated.

2.035: Reactivated some of the model-based functionality within the GO framework. Minor bugfixes.

2.034: Adding a generic parameter control method for optimizers, currently used by PSO to adapt inertness depending
 			on EvaluationTerminator or GenerationTerminator instances defining the number of function evaluations.
 			The new package is eva2.server.go.operators.paramcontrol.
 			A Population may now be ordered by a specific fitness criterion, employed, e.g., by Nelder-Mead-Simplex.

2.033: There was an interesting problem with the Matlab-Interface, which just hung up after extensive optimization
 			loops, yet only if Matlab was started without X-forwarding (which is necessary for qsub, e.g.).
 			Debugging was tedious, since the debugging using System.out. itself caused threading deadlocks. The 
 			problem showed up to be with System.out itself. Whatever Matlab does with that stream, it does it differently
 			depending on the X-forwarding option. More specifically, the text written to System.out when X-forwarding
 			is not available seems to never show up (as opposed to being printed to the console when X-forwarding is on)
 			and silently fill up the JVM-memory. I havent the faintest idea why there havnt been OutOfMemory exceptions
 			earlier or whether and how the deadlocks have to do with it. 
 			The ingenious solution was: dont print anything to System.out, which is now done at verbosity 0.

2.032: Some cosmetics, e.g. to AbstractEAIndividualComparator and older MOCCO classes. 

2.031: Some updates to the OptimizerFactory. Review of the MatlabInterface with adding an own options structure.
 			Better access to the EvAClient, which now may have a RemoteStateListener added monitoring the optimization run.

2.030: Added an EnumEditor to access enums easily through the GUI, which will replace SelectedTags sometimes.
 			IPOP-ES and RankMuCMA mutator have been added lately (wow!).
 			Cleaned up the IndividualInterface and reduced the usage of InterfaceESIndividual. This
 			means that, e.g., that DE and PSO now also work on GAIndividualDoubleData. Because this 
 			requires much time for transcoding, however, this is not useful by itself. Yet it could be
 			interesting for combined individuals composed of two data types. 
 			Cleaned up MutateXXDefault to a single MutateDefault, too. DE may now do range checking.
 			The "Description" button has made space for a "Show Solution" button. The Rank-Mu-CMA was improved
 			to use a CMAParameterSet which is associated with populations and not static any more.
 			Included Nelder-Mead-Simplex and CMA-ES as post processing methods.

2.029: Tuned the 2d-graphs which now paints quicker and changes size depending on the
			surrounding plot window. Added a preloader-thread to accelerate the GUI at starting time.

2.028: Tuned the Population to sort only when necessary on calls to getBestN... Added StatisticsDummy.
			Slightly tuned SimpleProblemWrapper to call initProblem of simple problems if available.

2.027: Renamed SetData and SetDataLamarckian from individual data type interfaces to SetGenotype and SetPhenotype.
			Repaired the GenericArrayEditor. Population measures can now be plotted in stats.

2.026: Added DiversityTerminator and KnownOptimaTerminator, slightly changed InterfaceTerminator for these
			and InterfaceStatistics to provide termination message to text window. 
			Killed redundant method getGenerations() in Population. Population.getAllSolutions now returns a 
			SolutionSet combining last population with a set of possibly archived solutions.
			Post processing with HC may now use variable step size mutation.

2.025: FunctionArea may now plot circles easily. The FLensProblemViewer seems to be cured. 

2.024: Cleaned up AbstractGOParams, deactivated parent logging (saving memory)

2.023: Cleaned up the PF strategy

2.022: Some changes to the SimpleProblemWrapper, not of great interest. However, simple problems may now access a plot 
quite easily.
