  abstract = {We present EvA2, a comprehensive metaheuristic optimization framework
	with emphasis on Evolutionary Algorithms implemented in Java. It
	presents a modular structure of interfaces and abstract classes for
	the implementation of optimization problems. End users may choose
	among several layers of abstraction for an entrance point meeting
	their requirements on both ease of use and access to extensive functionality.
	The EvA2 framework has been applied successfully in several academic
	as well as industrial cooperations and is extended continuously.
	It is freely available under an open source license (LGPL).},
