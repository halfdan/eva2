\chapter{Further Reading\label{sec:Further-Reading}}

As noted before, this introduction does not cover algorithmic basics.
We recommend the introduction of Engelbrecht \cite{Engelbrecht07CI}
for newer strategies (DE, PSO) and BÃ¤ck et al. \cite{Baeck99EC1}
for classical Evolutionary Algorithms. The applications note from
2010 gives some short and simple use cases for the framework \cite{Kron10EvA2}.
To go into details of\noun{ }EvA2, a look on the technical report
of 2005 \cite{JOptDocumentation}, though slightly outdated, will
still be helpful, as well as the thesis of Felix Streichert \cite{Streichert07},
one of the main authors of \noun{JavaEvA}.
