</center><br>
The phenotype convergence terminator stops the optimization when there has been hardly 
any change in the best population individual (within percentual or absolute distance) for a certain 
time span, given in generations or fitness calls.<br>
Be aware that, if the optimum individual is close to zero, it may happen that its phenotype values
fluctuate due to numeric issues and do not easily converge in a relative measure.<br>
