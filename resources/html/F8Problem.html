<p>
Ackley's function is multimodal and symmetrical. It is based on an exponential function and modulated by a cosine function.
The outside region is almost planar as to the growing influence of the exponential function. 
In the center there is a steep hole as to the influence of the cosine function.<br> 
Its minimum is at: <i>f(x)</i>=<i>f</i>([0, 0, ... , 0])=0.
<p>
The difficulty for an optimization algorithm is mid-graded because a simple optimization-algorithm like <i>hill-climbing</i> would get stuck in a local minimum. The optimization algorithm has to search a broader environ to overcome the local minimum and get closer to the global optima.
