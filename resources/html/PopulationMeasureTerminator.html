<center>
</center><br>
 An abstract class giving the framework for terminators based on
 a population measure converging for a given time (number of evaluations or 
 generations).
 The class detects changes of a population P using a measure m over time and may signal convergence 
 if the measure m(P) behaved in a certain way for a given time. Convergence may
 be signaled 
 <ul>
  <li>if the measure reached absolute values below convThresh (absolute value),</li>
  <li>if the measure remained within m(P)+/-convThresh (absolute change),</li>
  <li>if the measure remained above m(P)-convThresh (absolute change and regard improvement only),</li>
  <li>if the measure remained within m(P)*[1-convThresh, 1+convThresh] (relative change),</li>
  <li>if the measure remained above m(P)*(1-convThresh) (relative change and regard improvement only).</li>
 </ul>
The fitness convergence terminator stops the optimization, when there has been hardly 
any change in the best fitness in the population (within percentual or absolute distance) for a certain 
time, given in generations or fitness calls. In case of multi-objective optimization, the 2-norm of
the fitness vector is
currently used.<br>
Be aware that, if the optimization is allowed to be non-monotonic, such as for (,)-ES strategies,
and if the optimum is close to zero, it may happen that the fitness fluctuates due to numeric 
issues and does not easily converge in a relative way.<br>
