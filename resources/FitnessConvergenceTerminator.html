The fitness convergence terminator stops the optimization, when there has been hardly 
any change in the best population fitness (within percentual or absolute distance) for a certain 
time, given in generations or fitness calls.<br>
Be aware that, if the optimization is allowed to be non-monotonic, such as for (,)-ES strategies,
and if the optimum is close to zero, it may happen that the fitness fluctuates due to numeric 
issues and does not easily converge in a relative measure.
