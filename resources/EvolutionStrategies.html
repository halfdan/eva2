An ES works on a population of real valued solutions
by repeated use of evolutionary operators like reproduction,
recombination and mutation (see pseudocode in figures.
lambda offspring individuals are generated from mu parents
by recombination and mutation. After evaluating the fitness of the lambda
offspring individuals, mu individuals with the best fitness are
selected by a comma-strategy to build the parent population for the next generation.
On the other hand, a plus-strategy selects the best mu individuals
from the aggregation of parents and offspring individuals.
The properties of ES are given in the population sub frame.
