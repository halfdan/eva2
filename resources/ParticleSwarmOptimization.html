The Particle Swarm Optimization by Kennedy and Eberhardt is inspired by swarm intelligent
behaviour seen in animals like birds or ants. A swarm of particles is a set of individual agents
"flying" across the search space with individual velocity vectors. There is no selection as in
classic Evolutionary Algorithms. Instead, the individuals exchange knowledge about the space they
have come across. Each one is attracted to the best position the individual has seen so far (cognitive 
component) and to the best position known by its neighbors (social component).<br>
The neighborhood is defined by the swarm velocity, which may be a linear ordering, a grid and some others.
The influence of the velocity of the last time-step is taken into account using an inertness/
constriction parameter, which controls the convergence behaviour of the swarm.
The influence of social and cognitive attraction are weighed using the <i>phi</i> parameters. In the
constriction variant there is a dependence enforced between constriction and the phi, making sure that
the swarm converges slowly but steadily, see the publications of Clerc, e.g. <br>
