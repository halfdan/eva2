Statistical options are:
<ul>
  <li>Convergence rate threshold. Provided the target value is zero, 
  convergence is assumed if a value smaller than this threshold is reached. 
  For multi-run experiments, the number of hits is counted using this criterion.</li>
  <li>Number of multi-runs. To achieve statistically meaningful results on how well
  a certain optimizer works on a given problem, set this number to do several runs in a row. 
  The plot will be averaged, while all data can be collected in an output file or text window.</li>
  <li>The fitness to plot. Define which fitness values to plot to the graph window after every 
  generation. Select "best", "worst" or both.</li>
  <li>Result file name. If you want to collect optimization data, set this String to a desired file name.
   Optimization results will be written to the indicated file in the working directory.</li>
  <li>Show text output. If activated, the optimization data will also be shown in a graphical text 
  window for immediate viewing.</li>
</ul>
